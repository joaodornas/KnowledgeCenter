ANNEX J - FPF RENAME FLAG IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE (INFORMATIVE)

[pag 729]
J.1 General

The Rename flag is used to specify whether fields imported from the template shall be renamed in the event of name conflicts with existing fields;

[pag 729]
J.2 Implementation Example 

If the Rename flag in the FDF template dictionary is true, fields with such conflicting names shall be renamed to guarantee their uniqueness. 
If Rename is false, the fields shall not be renamed; this results in multiple fields with the same name in the target document. 
Each time the FDF file provides attributes for a given field name, all fields with that name shall be updated.

This can be implemented by a conforming product renaming fields by prepending a page number, a template name, and an ordinal number to the field name. 
The ordinal number corresponds to the order in which the template is applied to a page, with 0 being the first template specified for the page.

EXAMPLE 
If the first template used on the fifth page has the name Template and has the Rename flag set to true, fields defined in that template are renamed by prepending the character string P5 . 
Template_0 . to their field names.
