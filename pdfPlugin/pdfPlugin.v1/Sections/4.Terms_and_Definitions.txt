4 Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, these terms and definitions apply.

4.1
… (ellipsis)
An ellipsis is used within PDF examples to indicate omitted detail. Pairs of ellipses are also used to bracket comments, in italic, about such omitted detail.

4.2
8-bit value
(see byte)

4.3
array object
a one-dimensional collection of objects arranged sequentially and implicitly numbered starting at 0

4.4
ASCII
the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a widely used convention for encoding a specific set of 128 characters as binary numbers defined in ANSI X3.4-1986

4.5
binary data
an ordered sequence of bytes

4.6
boolean objects
either the keyword true or the keyword false

4.7
byte
a group of 8 binary digits which collectively can be configured to represent one of 256 different values and various realizations of the 8 binary digits are widely used in today's electronic equipment

4.8
catalog
the primary dictionary object containing references directly or indirectly to all other objects in the document with the exception that there may be objects in the trailer that are not referred to by the catalog

4.9
character
numeric code representing an abstract symbol according to some defined character encoding rule

NOTE 

1 There are three manifestations of characters in PDF, depending on context:

	•	A PDF file is represented as a sequence of 8-bit bytes, some of which are interpreted as character codes in the ASCII character set and some of which are treated as arbitrary binary data depending upon the context.
	
	•	The contents (data) of a string or stream object in some contexts are interpreted as character codes in the PDFDocEncoding or UTF-16 character set.
	
	•	The contents of a string within a PDF content stream in some situations are interpreted as character codes that select glyphs to be drawn on the page according to a character encoding that is associated with the text font.

name object
an atomic symbol uniquely defined by a sequence of characters introduced by a SOLIDUS (/), (2Fh) but the SOLIDUS is not considered to be part of the name

object
