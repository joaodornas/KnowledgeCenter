[27] Glassner, A. S. (ed.), Graphics Gems, Academic Press, 1993. The section “An Algorithm for Automatically Fitting Digitized Curves” by Philip J. Schneider describes an algorithm for determining the set of Bézier curves approximating an arbitrary set of user-provided points. Appendix 2 contains an implementation of the algorithm, written in the C programming language. Other sections relevant to the mathematics of Bézier curves include “Solving the Nearest-Point-On-Curve Problem” and “A Bézier Curve-Based Root-Finder,” both by Philip J. Schneider, and “Some Properties of Bézier Curves” by Ronald Goldman.

[33] Kirk, D. (ed.), Graphics Gems III, Academic Press, 1994. The section “Interpolation Using Bézier Curves” by Gershon Elber contains an algorithm for calculating a Bézier curve that passes through a user-specified set of points. The algorithm uses not only cubic Bézier curves, which are supported in PDF, but also higher-order Bézier curves. The appendix contains an implementation of the algorithm, written in the C programming language. The source code appearing in the appendix is available via anonymous FTP, as described in the book’s preface .
